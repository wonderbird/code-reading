# Code Reading

Tipps and tools helping to understand a code base (and changes) quickly.

## Motivation

Every developer needs to understand a large code base at least every time she enters a new job or project. For a common
considerably large code base, it can take up to six or even twelve months until you feel confident enough to contribute
without breaking things.

This repository shall give suggestions which simplify and streamline the tedious task so that you improve your
understanding quickly and even have fun.

## Standards, Status and Commitment
